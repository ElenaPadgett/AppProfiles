# AppProfiles
This is a guided project from DataQuest.io (online platform to learn Data Analysis and Data Science). 

The learning goal of the project was to review common data types, lists, for loops, conditional statements, dictionaries, and functions.

We pretend we are working for a company that builds apps for App Store and Google Play. We work with a dataset of about 10K Android apps and about 7K iOS apps. The goal of our analysis is to find out which genres seem to be liked by most users.

The data and code in Part I was part of the course. Part II is my original work.
