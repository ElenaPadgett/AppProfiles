# AppProfiles
This is a guided project from DataQuest.io (online platform to learn Data Analysis and Data Science). 

The learning goal of the project was to review common data types, lists, for loops, conditional statements, dictionaries, and functions.

The data and code in Part I was part of the course. Part II is my original work.
